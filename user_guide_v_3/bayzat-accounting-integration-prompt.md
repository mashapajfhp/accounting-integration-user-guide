# Bayzat Accounting Integration Documentation Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive instructions for documenting Bayzat's Accounting Integration feature, based on real interface testing and user experience research.

## Key Documentation Principles

### 1. Accuracy First - CRITICAL
- **NO fabricated statistics** - Never include unsupported percentages, metrics, or performance targets
- **NO made-up technical specifications** - Do not include browser requirements, version numbers, or technical specs without verification
- **NO invented change logs** - Do not create version histories or feature timelines without actual data
- **Test everything** - Use live interface testing to verify functionality
- **Real screenshots only** - Capture actual interface states, not assumptions
- **Factual language** - Use supportable claims like "improves" and "reduces" instead of absolutes
- **Document observed behavior only** - Include only what was actually tested and confirmed

### 2. Business Context Priority
- **Why before How** - Explain business value before technical steps
- **Role-specific insights** - Include PM-FOCUS and DESIGNER-FOCUS sections
- **Strategic value** - Connect features to business outcomes and ROI
- **Real-world impact** - Focus on practical benefits and use cases

## Critical Interface Elements to Document

### Step 1: Basic Setup Configuration

#### Base Currency
- **Source**: Inherited from initial company onboarding in Bayzat
- **Not user-configurable** during integration setup
- **Must match** accounting system's base currency
- **Warning required** if mismatch exists

#### Cost Centers Configuration
- **Define cost centers clearly** - Explain accounting concept for expense tracking
- **Four options**: None, Use departments, Use offices, Use Custom Employee Data
- **Multi-dimensional cost centers** - Document concept but note Bayzat doesn't support this yet
- **Business examples**: Department-based, location-based, project-based, function-based

#### Mode of Entry Configuration
- **Two approaches**: Global Mode vs Individual Line-Item Selection
- **Three options**: Consolidated entry, Entry per employee, Entry per cost center
- **Global vs Line-Item**:
  - Global: One mode applies to all payment methods
  - Line-Item: Different modes for different payment methods
- **Decision guidance**: When to use each approach

#### Payment Method Mapping
- **Sources explained**:
  - Bank Accounts: From Settings → Payroll → Bank Accounts
  - Exchange Houses: Pre-configured services (UAE Exchange, Al Ansari, etc.)
  - Others: Standard methods (Cash, Cheque)
- **Mapping process**: Bayzat payment method → Accounting system account
- **Flexible requirements**: NOT required to map every payment method
- **Minimum requirement**: At least one payment method must be mapped

#### Unlisted Bank Accounts
- **Solution**: "Setup a new bank account" button
- **Process**: Navigate to bank management → Add new → Return to integration
- **Draft preservation**: Configuration saved during bank account addition

### Step 2: Map Pay Items with Accounts

#### Primary Purpose
- **Translation layer** between HR/payroll language and accounting language
- **Critical mapping** of each pay element to financial system accounts
- **Dual account configuration**: Main account (paid) vs Liability account (unpaid) for accrual accounting

#### Interface Structure
- **Two-column system**: "On Bayzat" vs "On [Accounting System]"
- **Dual account logic**: Separate accounts for paid and unpaid scenarios
- **Preview functionality**: Users can validate mapping results before final configuration
- **Mode override capability**: Individual pay items can override global settings

#### Visual Status Indicators
- **Green checkmark** (✅): Section completely configured
- **Red/pink filled circle with white exclamation mark (!)**: Missing/incomplete mappings
- **No icon**: Configuration not started
- **Progressive configuration**: Visual feedback prevents missed requirements

#### Section-Level Mode Toggles
- **"Use this mode of entry for all items in [Section] configurations"**
- **Toggle ON**: All items in section use same mode (uniform approach)
- **Toggle OFF**: Each item can have individual mode (granular control)
- **Data capturing impact**: Affects journal entry structure and reporting detail
- **Business recommendation**: Most organizations benefit from toggle ON for consistency

#### Preview Functionality Requirements
- **Activation prerequisites**: All mapping fields must be completed (main account, liability account, mode settings)
- **Modal content**: Shows configuration summary, journal entry structure, dual scenario display
- **Business value**: Error prevention, confidence building, training tool, validation

#### Next Button Activation
- **Required fields**: Cost centers, mode of entry, minimum one payment method mapped
- **Visual indicators**: Red warning icons indicate incomplete sections
- **Validation logic**: System prevents advancement with incomplete configuration

#### Business Impact Documentation Required
- **Financial Accuracy & Compliance**: Precise classification, audit trails, accrual accounting support
- **Operational Efficiency**: Eliminates manual entry, reduces reconciliation time, error prevention
- **Strategic Financial Management**: Cost tracking, cash flow visibility, budgeting support

### Step 3: Review & Save Configuration
- **Final validation gateway**: Comprehensive review and checkpoint before activation
- **Inline editing capability**: Edit buttons for modifications without full step navigation
- **Configuration summary**: Review all mapping decisions in organized format
- **Status transparency**: Shows mapped items vs "N/A" for unmapped items
- **Critical checkpoint**: Final opportunity to modify before integration becomes active

### Data Synchronization Usage

#### Prerequisites for Sync
- **Most recent closed month requirement**: Sync button only appears for most recently closed payroll month
- **Not available for**: Open/current months, older closed months, future months
- **Two access paths**: Settings → Payroll → Accounting Integration → "transaction page" link OR Payroll → Transactions → Select closed month

#### Sync Process Testing
- **Sync button visibility**: Confirmed to appear only for closed months with proper integration setup
- **Background processing**: Sync runs automatically using mapping configuration
- **Error scenarios**: Authentication errors (401), server errors (500), configuration conflicts
- **Real-world limitations**: Demo environments may not support full sync execution

### Sync Report Template Configuration (Critical Prerequisite)

#### Report Template Purpose
- **Prerequisite for viewing sync results**: Cannot view sync reports without configuring report template first
- **Custom report structure**: Defines what data fields appear in sync reports
- **Business intelligence**: Enables analysis of payroll-to-accounting data flow
- **Audit support**: Provides detailed transaction-level visibility

#### Report Template Setup Process
- **Access path**: Settings → Payroll → Accounting Integration → ellipse menu (⋯) → "Edit/View report"
- **3-step process**: Basic Setup (name), Map Data (column mapping), Review & Save
- **Column mapping**: Define what information appears in sync reports

#### Essential Report Columns
- **Journal Post Date**: When accounting entry was created
- **Journal Entry Name**: Description of accounting entry
- **Account ID/Name**: Which accounting accounts were used
- **Cost Center ID/Name**: Organizational cost allocation
- **Debit/Credit Amounts**: Financial amounts synchronized
- **Employee Name**: Individual employee identification
- **Department**: Organizational structure tracking

#### Report Template Configuration States
| Configuration Status | Sync Report Available? | Action Required |
|---------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Template not configured | No | Configure report template first |
| Template configured, not synced | No | Execute sync for closed payroll month |
| Template configured & synced | Yes | Access sync reports and download detailed breakdown |

#### Sync Report Workflow (Expected)
1. **Click sync button** → Pre-sync report modal appears
2. **Review pre-sync report** → Check currency conversions, mappings, errors
3. **Confirm sync** → Execute actual data transfer
4. **Post-sync report** → View completion status and detailed results
5. **Download report** → Access comprehensive sync documentation

## Documentation Structure Requirements
