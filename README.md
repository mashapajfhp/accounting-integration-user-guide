# Bayzat Accounting Integration - V5 Prototype User Guide

## 🎯 Prototype Overview

This prototype demonstrates a **task-focused, user-centered approach** to user guide design based on best practices from GitHub Docs, Webex Help, Document360 guidelines, and enterprise software documentation patterns.

## 🔄 Evolution from V4 to V5

### **V4 Issues Identified:**
- Still feature-oriented despite improvements
- Single monolithic document (3600+ lines)
- Limited progressive disclosure
- No clear user journey differentiation
- Mixed content complexity levels

### **V5 Prototype Solutions:**
- **Task-oriented organization** based on user goals
- **Modular design** with separate pages for different needs
- **Progressive disclosure** through guided pathways
- **Interactive elements** for better engagement
- **Decision trees** for troubleshooting
